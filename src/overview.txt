This program is a system of Companies, Projects, Workers and Qualifications that are based on real
world representations.  A Company consists of Projects and Workers with Qualifications.  Projects
are started with n amount of workers with Qualifications that contribute to the overall success of
the project.  This program was written in Java 8 and tested with Jnit5 (using the jupiter and vintage)
engines.  There were use cases for using Theories and DataPoints in some of the tests, which allowed
for limited code duplication.   There is a test suite (TestAll.java) that runs both engines.

Incomplete Specifications
-------------------------
The Qualification class adds Workers and Projects to a set per the spec, but this set is not used
anywhere else in the code.

The Company class

The test suite could have been decoupled from eachother with the use of mocks.  Testing Company was
done using concrete implementations of Projects, Qualifications and Workers.  While this still
adequately tests the system, some loss of control was experienced and additional setup was required
to achieve the right functionality.



Issues Encountered
------------------
The definition of a load was loosely defined in the spec.  Based on the documentation for willOverload,
this was assumed to be (3*numberOfLargeProjects + 2*numberOfMediumProjects + numberOfSmall Projects).
With this assumption, computeCurrentLoad was implemented in the same fashion.


Challenges
----------
There was some research required to utilize Theory and DataPoints functionality; these utilities
require a little time and finesse to properly test various sets of data.
